# Testnet Marketplace

**Project Concept**

Testnet Marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can **discover ongoing testnets**, **exchange testnet tokens**, and **track project incentives** ‚Äî all in one place.

Built on **Zama‚Äôs FHEVM**, it ensures full **data privacy** and **encrypted on-chain operations**, giving users a safe way to interact without revealing personal data.

---

## Vision
To simplify testnet participation while creating an economy for early adopters ‚Äî powered by privacy and decentralization.

---

## Tech Stack
- Zama FHEVM for privacy-preserving smart contracts  
- Solidity for contract logic  
- Future integration with testnet APIs and analytics dashboards  

---

## Next Steps
1. Set up FHEVM environment  
2. Design smart contract for token listing  
3. Build basic front-end (optional, later)  
4. Invite contributors to test and expand

# üß© Testnet Marketplace Architecture

## 1. Core Idea

A Testnet Marketplace where:

- Users can buy and sell testnet tokens securely.  
- They can also discover ongoing and upcoming testnets for farming or airdrops.  
- The platform rewards participation and reputation growth.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Updated Architecture Overview

| Layer | Description | Tools / Options |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Frontend (UI)** | User interface for listings, wallet connection, dashboard | Next.js + TailwindCSS + Wagmi + RainbowKit + Base App + Rabby |
| **Smart Contracts** | Handles listing, escrow, and trades | Solidity + Hardhat or Foundry |
| **Backend / Indexer** | Tracks marketplace data, prices, and user activity | Node.js (Express) + PostgreSQL / MongoDB |
| **Blockchain Layer** | Base chain for primary interactions + optional Monad testnet | Base Testnet / Sepolia / Monad |
| **Data Aggregation Layer** | Aggregates live testnet data from APIs (Kaito, Zama, Airdrops.io, etc.) | Custom API endpoints |
| **Privacy Layer** | FHE-enabled transactions using Zama‚Äôs fhevm | Zama AI SDK |
| **AI Layer (Optional)** | Summarizes testnet projects, user patterns, and recommendations | Kaito API + OpenAI API |

## üß† 3. Wallet Integration

You‚Äôll support three wallet types for flexibility and security:

### a. Base App (Base Wallet)
- Default onboarding path for new users.  
- Built-in fiat-to-crypto bridge.  
- Native support for Base chain (main + testnet).  

### b. Rabby Wallet
- For advanced Web3 users.  
- One-click chain switching and better DApp connection.  
- Perfect for multi-chain testnet hunters.  

### c. RainbowKit / Wagmi
- Provides unified wallet connection logic.  
- Easy integration with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and others.  
- Simplifies wallet authentication on frontend.  

**Example Wallet Setup Code:**

```js
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { rabbyWallet, metaMaskWallet, baseWallet } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/wallets';
```
üèóÔ∏è 4. Key Functional Modules

a. User Module

Connect wallet (Base / Rabby / MetaMask)

Profile setup + wallet verification

XP, badges, on-chain reputation


b. Marketplace

List testnet tokens for sale

Escrow smart contract (holds until buyer confirms)

Buy, claim, and dispute resolution

Private listings (FHE encrypted)


c. Testnet Discovery

Aggregated list of projects running testnets

Filter by category, reward, or chain

One-click to join testnet or faucet


d. Escrow + Payment Logic

Smart contract-based escrow

Multi-chain (Base, Monad)

Optional Zama encryption for amounts



---

üîê 5. Privacy & FHE Integration (Zama)

Zama‚Äôs fhevm lets you encrypt listings and trade data while keeping it functional.
Use it to:

Hide trade amounts

Protect user balances

Perform verifiable encrypted operations


Example Solidity Snippet:

import "fhevm/lib/FHE.sol";

uint256 encryptedPrice = FHE.encrypt(0.2 ether);
FHE.decrypt(encryptedPrice); // only contract can access


---

üöÄ 6. MVP Rollout Plan

Phase 1 (MVP)

UI (Next.js + Wagmi + Base/Rabby)

Smart contracts (listing + escrow)

Backend (data + API)

Basic testnet listing dashboard


Phase 2

Add Zama FHE privacy

Integrate AI testnet recommendations

Launch user XP and reputation scoring


Phase 3

DAO governance + staking rewards

Base-native token economy

Cross-chain integration (Monad, Polygon, etc.)



---

üß∞ 7. No-Code / Low-Code Stack (Optional)

If you don‚Äôt code, use this combo:

Thirdweb for contract deployment

Moralis for wallet auth + testnet data

Bubble.io or Typedream for frontend

Replit + ChatGPT for smart contract scaffolding

Zama Sandbox for FHE simulation
